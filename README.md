# Bank-Loan-Prediction
In this project, we use a machine learning technique that will predict the person who is reliable for a loan, based on the previous record of the person whom the loan amount is accredited before. This work's primary objective is to predict whether the loan approval to a specific individual is safe or not.


Loan is an important sector in the Bank. People need loans for their Businesses and  other  requirements.Loans  are  the  core  business  of  banks. The  main  profit comes directly from the loan’s interest.

### Steps involved in the ML project are as follows:
#### • Understand and define the problems.
#### • Analyze and prepare the data.
#### • Apply the algorithms.
#### • Reduce the errors.
#### • Predict the result.

# Some snapshots of Graphs

## 1. Heat Map:

![Heat map graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75004804/134301730-884429fc-0a59-4f01-8c2d-c41b3342abd2.jpg)

• A heatmap contains values representing various shades of the same color for 
each value to be plotted. 

• The darker shades of the chart represent higher values than the lighter shade.

• As we can see in the above graph, the most correlated values are Income 
stability and Credit score.

• Heatmap helps user to able to identify highly correlated variables and this will 
allow them to stream line the features selection process.


## 2 Count Plot:

![countplot graph 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75004804/134302659-5d025f45-1a27-4e2a-97b1-a4067826c0bb.jpg)

• We will analyze this categorical variable using count plot as shown above. 

• This count plot shows that loan applicants of around 70% are from location 
Semi-Urban, Nearly 20% are Rural applicants and 10% are Urban applicants.

• The main idea of the count plot is similar to bar plot function.

• The count plot is majorly used for showing the observational count in different 
category based bins with the help of bars.


## 3 Line Plot:

![lineplot graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75004804/134302734-04042e34-6f45-4ae0-9c1e-927bc4a02492.jpg)

• A line graph connects individual data points that, typically, display 
quantitative values over a specified time interval.

• Line graphs use data point (markers) which are connected by straight lines. 
These data points, connected by straight lines, aid in visualization.

• While line graphs are used across many different fields for different purposes, 
they are especially helpful when it is necessary to create a graphical depiction 
of changes in values over time.

• Compare to the young people elders have the good Credit Score in which 
young people are not returning the loans on time which is given by the bank.

• As we can see in the graph there is rapid increase in credit score around the 
age group 60.

## 4 Box Plot:

![boxplot graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75004804/134302769-bb5f2d95-1ede-4a27-9227-50750ce62efb.jpg)

• A boxplot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based 
on five number summary “minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and 
maximum”.

• As we can see in the above graph, Working profession has more history of 
loan amount sanctioned than other professions and the next position is to 
commercial associate.

• Box plots visually show the distribution of numerical data and skewness 
through displaying the data quartiles (or percentiles) and averages.

• Commercial Assistant applicants request for loan compare to other 
professions and the next position is occupied by working.

• As we can see in the above graph loan amount request from the student is 
extremely low.


## 5 Count Plot:

![countplot graph 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75004804/134302805-1391fed4-749d-4484-b84e-d768f241ff7a.jpg)

• Loan applicant’s from age group 18 is huge compared to other age group 
applicant’s.

• And the next position is occupied by age group 65.

• The count plot is majorly used for showing the observational count in 
different category based bins with the help of bars.

• The count plot is used to represent the occurrence(counts) of the observation 
present in the categorical variable.


## 6 Bar Plot:

![barplot graph 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75004804/134302844-42200398-65af-495c-a3bb-a3b480feaafa.jpg)

• Form the above bar plot we can see that the applicants from Urban get more 
loan amount sanctioned compared to Rural and Semi-urban applicants.

• Bar plots are the pictorial representation of data (generally grouped), in the 
form of vertical or horizontal rectangular bars, where the length of bars are 
proportional to the measure of data. They are also known as bar charts.

• Loan sanctioned amount is more in Urban areas as we can predict the 
availability of jobs is more compare to Rural and Semi-urban areas.

• The applicant’s from Rural areas got less loan sanctioned amount due to lack 
of job opportunities.


## 7 Dist Plot:

![distplot graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75004804/134304227-15533c2d-b6b6-4dca-9ec0-47d40bcfc019.jpg)

• A Distplot or distribution plot, depicts the variation in the data distribution.

• In this plot, it accepts the data variable as an argument and returns the plot 
with the density distribution.

• The Distplot depicts the data by histogram and a line in combination to it.

• From the above graph we can conclude that the inactive credit cards is more 
than the active and Unpossessed credit cards.

• Bins is used to set the number of bins you want in your plot and it actually 
depends on your dataset.
